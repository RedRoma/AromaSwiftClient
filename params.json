You don't want to bombard Aroma with too many diagnostic messages that are better suited for Logging.\r\n\r\n### Set the Urgency\r\n>Set an Urgency to each message. Think of Urgency like you would a Log Severity Level. Using them allows you and your team to know just how important a message is.\r\n\r\n# Project Source\r\nAdditional info on the Swift Client can be found by visiting the [GitHub project](https://github.com/RedRoma/aroma-swift-client).",
